## 💹 Revenue Insights
- Discounting strategies have sacrificed over ₹49.4 Billion in potential revenue.
- There are substantial revenue opportunities in optimizing price points without compromising customer satisfaction.

- Several products have less than 1,000 reviews, presenting opportunities for marketing boosts.

# 🎯 Actionable Insights
1. **Optimize Discount Strategy**: While discounts drive engagement, high discounts result in significant revenue loss. Aim for a balance — consider A/B testing various discount thresholds.
2. **Leverage High-Performing Categories**: Electronics and Accessories drive the most reviews and revenue. Invest more in inventory, marketing, and customer experience in these categories.
3. **Push Low-Visibility Products**: Products with excellent ratings but low reviews should be promoted — via featured listings or influencer partnerships — to boost awareness.
4. **Bundle Low-Rated, High-Discount Items**: Combine weaker products with stronger ones in bundles to improve sales volume without impacting individual revenue margins too deeply.
5. **Price Range Segmentation**: Products priced between ₹200–₹500 dominate in count. Consider segment-specific promotions to target budget-conscious customers.
6. **Revenue Impact Awareness**: ₹49B lost to discounting suggests a revenue recovery strategy is needed — consider dynamic pricing, especially during non-peak seasons.
